Somebody once told me the world was going to roll me I ain't the sharpest toll in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an L on her forehead
Well the years stop coming and they don't stop coming fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun your brain get smart but your head gets dumb
